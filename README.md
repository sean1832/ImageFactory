# :camera:Image Factory
A simple Windows Form desktop application to batch convert varies image formats.

(This is my earlier program that I wrote when I was learning C#, 
so the source codes are pretty messy. 
I will try to clean it up at some point) :wink:.

1. Currently [ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) is required to convert `.ai` file
### Opperation
